Notes:

Quick use: simply drag-n-drop the Farmhouse prefab from the asset folder into your project.
The door can not be opened. If you created an interior, you need to teleport your Player. 
The door is a single mesh so you can easily program an interaction with it. 
Most of the textures are in Ultra-HD quality. To safe performance, change texture quality 
to 2048 or less pixels in import settings.
Depending on the light in your scene, adjust Specular Color and Shininess of all used materials. 
The single houseparts can be combined however you like. 
To change the sky reflexion on the windows, simply edit the cubemap named "Sky_reflective". 
Add the correct images from your skybox.
